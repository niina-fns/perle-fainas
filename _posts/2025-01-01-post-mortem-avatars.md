This report addresses the European Parliament, and more precisely the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), to further investigate the emerging challenges and implications of grief technology. The use of digital post-mortem avatars created through artificial intelligence continues to rise, with very little regulation from our institutions. The direction taken by the European Union should shift from an individual and liberal perspective on the choice of avatar recreation after death to a limited transitional possibility for the relatives, for both ethical and judicial reasons. The case that will be highlighted in the report is HereAfterAI, a platform that preserves memories through interviews of an individual before their death. These memories are then transformed into a chatbot that the relatives can use to converse with their deceased loved ones. This case exemplifies the growing trend towards liberal individualism in digital rights across the European Union, in which living individuals can dictate the use of their personal data and digital avatars after their death.
